# Exercise: Queries and Mutations
# Practice writing GraphQL operations.

# Given this schema:
# type User {
#   id: ID!
#   name: String!
#   email: String!
#   posts: [Post!]!
#   role: Role!
# }
#
# type Post {
#   id: ID!
#   title: String!
#   content: String!
#   published: Boolean!
#   author: User!
#   tags: [String!]!
#   comments: [Comment!]!
#   createdAt: String!
# }
#
# type Comment {
#   id: ID!
#   text: String!
#   author: User!
#   post: Post!
# }
#
# enum Role { USER ADMIN MODERATOR }
#
# input CreatePostInput { title: String!, content: String!, tags: [String!] }
# input UpdatePostInput { title: String, content: String, published: Boolean }

# Exercise 1: Basic Queries
# Write a query to get all published posts with their author name and tag list.

# TODO: Write GetPublishedPosts query


# Exercise 2: Variables
# Write a query that takes a user ID variable and returns:
# - The user's name, email, role
# - Their posts (title, published status, comment count)

# TODO: Write GetUserProfile query with $userId: ID! variable


# Exercise 3: Fragments
# Define a PostSummary fragment with: id, title, published, createdAt, author { name }
# Use it in a query that gets both published and draft posts (using aliases).

# TODO: Define PostSummary fragment
# TODO: Write GetPostsByStatus query using the fragment and aliases


# Exercise 4: Mutations
# Write mutations for:
# a) Creating a new post
# b) Updating a post (partial update)
# c) Deleting a post
# Each should return the affected post data.

# TODO: Write CreatePost mutation
# TODO: Write UpdatePost mutation
# TODO: Write DeletePost mutation


# Exercise 5: Directives
# Write a query that:
# - Takes $includeComments: Boolean! and $skipDrafts: Boolean! variables
# - Uses @include to optionally fetch comments
# - Uses @skip to optionally skip draft posts
# - Uses inline fragments for the User type to get role-specific data

# TODO: Write FlexiblePostsQuery with directives
